This is a webapp for a travel agency based in North America. Users have the option to first select the USA, Canada, or Mexico. 
Destinations will then be available via a checkbox, so users can decide what type of activity they would like to do in said 
country. There is also a currency conversion (assuming users live in the USA) so they can travel hassle-free.

We picked this project because we have a passion for traveling and figured it would be nice to have something that made 
choosing where to travel easier. This is something that we would personally use so we figured we would use our skills to make 
it happen for our final project.
