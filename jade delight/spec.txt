Your task is to add functionality to the HTML page provided (jade_delight.html)

You will need to figure out how the page was created as well as to write the Javascript for the additional functionality.

You may change the page formatting, but not the Javascript code already in place without asking permission first.

The following is what needs to be added to the page:


When a user selects a quantity
the amount should automatically be filled in to the corresponding total cost box.
The subtotal, tax and total should update and be filled in

When the user clicks submit:
Verify that the last name and phone are entered. The phone should be a valid phone number.
If the order was pickup, calculate the time 15 min from the order time
If the order was delivery, calculate the time 30 min from the order time for expected delivery time
If the order was delivery, the street and city are required
If there are validation issues, indicate the issue to the user.
If there are no validation issues, display a message that thanks the user for their order, displays the pickup or delivery time and the total amount for the order.
